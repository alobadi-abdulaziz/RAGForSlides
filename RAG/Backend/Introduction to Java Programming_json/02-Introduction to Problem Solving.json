This means you should determine what is that you want to change. \n\n     Clearly define the goal that you want to achieve. \n        What are you trying to achieve? \n\n     Determine what are the inputs and outputs \n\n     If you don't know what the problem is, you cannot solve it."

This includes understanding the rules or the logic for the business \n      (business rules or logic) you are attempt to solve a problem concerned with \n      it. \n    .
