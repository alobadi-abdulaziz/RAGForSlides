You can make an array of ints, doubles, or any other \n  type, but all the values in an array must have the same \n  type. \n\n  To create an array, you have to declare a variable with \n  an array type and then create the array itself. Array \n  types look like other Java types, except they are \n  followed by square brackets ([])."

You \n   should think of the array and the variable that refers to it as two different \n   things. \n\n   The large numbers inside the boxes are the elements of the array. The small \n   numbers outside the boxes are the indexes (or indices) used to identify each \n   location in the array. \n\n   Notice that the index of the first element is 0, not 1, as you might have \n   expected."

Consider the declaration \n  int[] a, b, c ;. Ifa, b and c should be declared as ar- \n  ray variables, then this declaration is correct-placing \n  square brackets directly following the type indicates that \n  all the identifiers in the declaration are array variables. \n  However, if only a is intended to be an array variable, \n  and b and c are intended to be individual int vari- \n  ables, then this declaration is incorrect-the declaration \n  int a[], b, c; would achieve the desired result."
