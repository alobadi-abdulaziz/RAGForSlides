For example: \n       x > 0 && x < 10 is true when x is greater than 0 and less than 10. \n       x < 0 | |   x > 10 is true if either condition is true; that is, if x is less \n       than 0 or greater than 10. \n       ! (x > 0) is true if x is not greater than 0. The parentheses are necessary \n       in this example because, in the order of operations, ! comes before >. \n  In order for an expression with && to be true, both sides of the \n  && operator must be true.
