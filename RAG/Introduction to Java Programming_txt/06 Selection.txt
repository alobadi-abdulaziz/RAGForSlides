Equality and Relational Operators 

  Java has six relational operators that test the relationship 
  between two values (e.g., whether they are equal, or whether 
  one is greater than the other). The following expressions 
  show how they are used: 



          Equality operators 
          =         ==              x == y       x is equal to y 
          !=        !=              x ! = y      x is not equal to y 

          Relational operators 
          >         >               x > y        x is greater than y 
          <         <                x < y        x is less than y 
          2         >=              x >= y       x is greater than or equal to y 
          5         <=              x <= y       x is less than or equal to y

Equality and Relational Operators (Cont.) 

  The result of a relational operator is a Boolean 
  data type, one of two special values: true or 
  false. 

  We call it Boolean expressions.

Equality and Relational Operators (Cont.) 
   Remember that: 

         = is the assignment operator, and == is a relational operator. 

        The operators =< and => do not exist. 

        The two sides of a relational operator have to be compatible. 
             For example, the expression 5 < "6" is invalid because 5 is an int and "6" is a String. 

        When comparing values of different numeric types, Java applies 

        the same conversion rulesyou saw previously with the 
        
        assignment operator. 
             For example, when evaluating the expression 5 < 6.0, Java automatically converts 
             the 5 to 5.0. 
                                                                                        6

Control Structures 

  Sequential execution: Statements in a program execute one after 
  the other in the order in which they are written. 

  Transfer of control: Various Java statements, enable you to specify 
  that the next statement to execute is not necessarily the next one in 
  sequence. 

· Bohm and Jacopini 
      Demonstrated that programs can be written in terms of only three 
      control structures-the sequence structure, the selection structure and 
      the repetition structure. 

. We refer to the control structures in the terminology of Java as 
  "control statements." 

                                                                     7

 Control Structures (Cont.) 

Three types of selection statements. 
· if statement: 
     · Performs an action, if a condition is true; skips it, if false. 
     · Single-selection statement-selects or ignores a single action (or group 
       of actions). 
· if ... else statement: 
       Performs an action if a condition is true and performs a different action 
       if the condition is false. 
     · Double-selection statement-selects between two different actions (or 
       groups of actions). 
· switch statement 
       Performs one of several actions, based on the value of an expression. 
       Multiple-selection statement-selects among many different actions (or 
       groups of actions). 

                                                                          8

The Single if Statement 

                                                                     
  To write useful programs, we almost always need to           
  check conditions and react accordingly. Conditional 
  statements give us this ability.                               
  The simplest conditional statement in Java is the if                                                            
  statement:                                                   
      if (x > 0) { 
          System. out.println("x is positive");              
       }                                                        

  The expression in parentheses is called the condition. 
    · If it is true, the statements in braces get executed. 
    · If the condition is false, execution skips over that block of 
      code. 
      The condition in parentheses can be any boolean expression. 

                                                                  10

The Single if Statement (Cont.) 

· if selection statement 
    · Allows a program to make a decision based on a condition's value. 
      An if statement always begins with keyword if, followed by a 
      condition in parentheses. 
· Condition 
      An expression that can be true or false. 
· Pseudocode

             Print "Passed" 
  The preceding pseudocode If in Java: 
          if ( studentGrade >= 60 ) 
                   System. out. println ( "Passed" ) ; 
  Indentation is optional, but recommended 
      Emphasizes the inherent structure of structured programs 

                                                                 11

The Single if Statement (Cont.) 

  An if statement expects one statement in its body, 
     if ( studentGrade >= 60 ) 
         System. out. println( "Passed" ) ; 
  but may contain multiple statements if they are enclosed in a 
  set of braces ( { }). 
        if ( studentGrade >= 60 ) 
        { 
             System. out.println( "Passed" ) ; 

          System. out.println( "Congratulations" ) ; 
        } 
  Note that there is no semicolon (;) at the end of the first line 
  of each if statement.

  This code is misleading because it's not indented correctly: 

 if (x > 0) 
   System. out.println("x is positive"); 
   System. out.println("x is not zero"); 

                         if (x > 0) { 
                          System. out.println("x is positive");

       Error-Prevention Tip 4.10 
       Assignment (=) expressions generally should not be used 
       in conditions. Every condition must result in a boo1- 
       ean value; otherwise, a compilation error occurs. In a 
       condition, an assignment will compile only if a bool- 
       ean expression is assigned to a boolean variable. 

                                                                 17 
<<<

The Single if Statement (Cont.) 
·In all previous examples, notice that there is no semicolon at the end of the if 
   or else lines. Instead, a new block should be defined using braces. Another 
   common mistake is to put a semicolon after the condition, like this: 

         int x = 1; 
         if (x % 2 == 0); { // incorrect semicolon 
         System.out.println("x is even"); } 
   Here is the same incorrect code with better formatting: 

          int x = 1; 
          if (x % 2 == 0) 
           ; // empty statement 
          { 
          System.out.println("x is even"); 
          } 

. Because of the semicolon, the if statement compiles as if there are no braces, 
   and the subsequent block runs independently. (Logical error!) 

                                                                          18 
<<<

The if-else Statement 

  A second form of conditional statement has two possibilities, 
  indicated by if and else. The possibilities are called branches, 
  and the condition determines which branch gets executed. 


                                                           19 
<<<

   The if-else Statement (Cont.) 
   . The braces are optional for branches that have only one 
     statement. 

if (x % 2 == 0) {                         if (x % 2 == 0) 
 System. out.println("x is even");         System.out.println("x is even"); 
} else {                                   else 
 System.out.println("x is odd"); }         System. out.println("x is odd"); 

   . If the remainder when x is divided by 2 is 0, we know that x is 
     even, and the program displays a message to that effect. If the 
     condition is false, the second print statement is executed 
     instead. 
   . Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one of the 
     branches will run. 

                                                                    20 
<<<

  The if-else Statement (Cont.) 

    The if statement normally expects only one statement in its body. 

    To include several statements in the body of an if (or the body of an 
    else for an if ... else statement), enclose the statements in braces.

    Statements contained in a pair of braces form a block. 

    A block can be placed anywhere that a single statement can be 
   placed.

    Example: A block in the else part of an if ... else statement: 

           if ( grade >= 60 ) 
              System. out. println( "Passed") ; 
           else 
           { 
              System. out. println("Failed"); 
block         System.out.println("You must take this course 
           again. ") ; 
           } 

                                                                  21 
<<<

The if-else Statement (Cont.) 

  The empty statement is represented by placing a 
  semicolon (; ) where a statement would normally 
  be. 

      Common Programming Error 3.1 
      Placing a semicolon after the condition in an if or 
      if ... else statement leads to a logic error in single-selec- 
      tion if statements and a syntax error in double-selection 
      if ... else statements (when the if-part contains an ac- 
      tual body statement).

 Chaining and Nesting 

Sometimes you want to check related conditions and choose one of several 
actions. 

One way to do this is by chaining a series of if and else blocks by placing if ... 
else statements inside other if ... else statements to create nested if ... 
else statements.

Chaining and Nesting (Cont.) 

  The Java compiler always associates an else with the immediately preceding if 
  unless told to do otherwise by the placement of braces ( { and } ). 

  Referred to as the dangling-else problem. 

  The following code is not what it appears: 
               if (x > 5) 
              if (y > 5) 
                  System. out.println("x and y are > 5" ) ; 
           else 
              System.out.println("x is <= 5");

. To force the nested if ... else statement to execute as it 
 was originally intended, we must write it as follows: 
        if (x > 5) 
        { 
            if (y > 5) 
               System. out. println("x and y are > 5") ; 
        } 
        else 
            System.out.println("x is <= 5"); 
. The braces indicate that the second if is in the body of 
 the first and that the else is associated with the first if.

Logical Operators 

  Java's logical operators enable you to form more 
  complex conditions by combining simple 
  conditions. 
  The logical operators are we are interesting in are: 
   · && (conditional AND) 
   · | (conditional OR) 
   · ! (logical NOT)

Logical Operators (Cont.) 

  In addition to the relational operators, Java also has three logical 
  operators: &&, ||, and !, which respectively stand for and, or, and 
  not. 

  The results of these operators are similar to their meanings in 
  English. For example: 
       x > 0 && x < 10 is true when x is greater than 0 and less than 10. 
       x < 0 | |   x > 10 is true if either condition is true; that is, if x is less 
       than 0 or greater than 10. 
       ! (x > 0) is true if x is not greater than 0. The parentheses are necessary 
       in this example because, in the order of operations, ! comes before >. 
  In order for an expression with && to be true, both sides of the 
  && operator must be true. And in order for an expression with || to 
  be false, both sides of the || operator must be false. 

                                                                            31

. The && (conditional AND) operator ensures that two conditions are both 
  true before choosing a certain path of execution. 

  Java evaluates to false or true all expressions that include relational 
  operators, equality operators or logical operators.

 · The && operator can be used to simplify nested if 
   statements. For example, the following code can be rewritten 
   with a single condition: 

if (x == 0) { 
 if (y == 0) { 
     System. out.println("Both x and y are zero"); 
 } 
} 

            // combined 
            if (x == 0 && y == 0) { 
                System.out.println("Both x and y are zero"); 
            }

  The || operator can simplify chained if statements. Since the 
  branches are the same, there is no need to duplicate that 
  code: 

if (x == 0) {

} else if (y == 0) { 
   System.out.println("Either x or y is zero");

· Logical operators evaluate the second expression only 
  when necessary. 
      For example, true | | anything is always true, so Java does not 
      need to evaluate the expression anything. 
      Likewise, false && anything is always false. 

  Ignoring the second operand, when possible, is called 
  short-circuit evaluation. 

  Short-circuit evaluation can save time, especially if 
  anything takes a long time to evaluate. It can also avoid 
  unnecessary

                this the dependent condition-may require another 
                condition to be true for the evaluation of the dependent 
                condition to be meaningful. In this case, the dependent 
                condition should be placed after the && operator to pre- 
                vent errors. Consider the expression (i != 0) && (10 / 
                 i == 2). The dependent condition (10 / i == 2) 
                must appear after the && operator to prevent the possi- 
                bility of division by zero.

Logical Operators (Cont.) 

The ! (logical NOT, also called logical negation or logical complement) 
operator "reverses" the meaning of a condition. 
The logical negation operator is a unary operator that has only one condition 
as an operand. 
The logical negation operator is placed before a condition to choose a path 
of execution if the original condition (without the logical negation operator) 
is false. 
In most cases, you can avoid using logical negation by expressing the 
condition differently with an appropriate relational or equality operator.

Conditional Operator 

  Conditional operator (? : )-can be used in place of an if ... else 
  statement. 
  Ternary operator (takes three operands) 
  Operand to the left of the ? is a boolean expression-evaluates to a 
  boolean value (true or false) 
  Second operand (between the ? and : ) is the value if the boolean 
  expression is true 
  Third operand (to the right of the : ) is the value if the boolean 
  expression evaluates to false. 
· Example: 
        System. out. println(studentGrade >= 60 ? "Passed" : "Failed") ; 
  Evaluates to the string "Passed" if the boolean expression 
  studentGrade >= 60 is true and to the string "Failed" if it is 
  false. 
                  Error-Prevention Tip 3.2 
                  Use expressions of the same type for the second and third 
                  operands of the ?: operator to avoid subtle errors. 
                                                                     41

Switch Multiple-Selection Statement 

. If you need to make a series of decisions, 
  chaining else if blocks can get long and

  "three" if (number == 1) {        This chain could go on and on !

Switch Multiple-Selection Statement (Cont.) 

  An alternative way to evaluate many possible values of an 
  expression is to use a switch statement. 

  switch multiple-selection statement performs different 
  actions based on the possible values of a constant integral 
  expression of type byte, short, int or char. 

        switch (number) { 
         case 1: word = "one"; 
                 break; 
         case 2: word = "two";

         default : word = "unknown"; 
                  break;

Switch Multiple-Selection Statement (Cont.) 
. The switch statement consists of a block that 
  contains a sequence of case labels and an optional 
  default case. 
  The program evaluates the controlling expression 
  in the parentheses following keyword switch. 
  The program compares this expression's value 
  (which must evaluate to an integral value of type 
  byte, char, short or int, or to a 
  String) with each case label.

Switch Multiple-Selection Statement (Cont.) 

  The body of a switch statement is organized into 
  one or more case blocks. 
. If a match occurs, the program executes that 
  case ' S statements. 

. The break statement causes program control to 
  proceed with the first statement after the switch. 
. The default block is optional and executed only 
  if none of the cases apply. 

          Common Programming Error 4.7 
          Forgetting a break statement when one is needed in a 
          switch is a logic error.

Switch Multiple-Selection Statement (Cont.) 

  switch does not provide a mechanism for testing 
  ranges of values- every value must be listed in a 
  separate case label. 
  switch differs from other control statements in that it 
  does not require braces around multiple statements in 
  a case. 
  Without break, the statements for a matching case 
  and subsequent cases execute until a break or the end 
  of the switch is encountered. This is called "falling 
  through." 
. If no match occurs between the controlling 
  expression's value and a case label, the default case 
  executes. 
. If no match occurs and there is no default case, 
  program control simply continues with the first 
  statement after the switch.
