General Problem Solving 

. People make decisions every day to solve problems that affect their lives 

    Important problems 
    Unimportant problem 

· Bad/Good decision 
<<<

Six Steps of Problem Solving 

. There are six steps to follow to ensure the best decision. 
  Most people use them without even knowing it: 
   1. Identify the problem. 
   2. Understand the problem. 
   3. Identify alternative ways to solve the problem. 
   4. Select the best way to solve the problem from the list of 
      alternative solutions. 
   5. List instructions that enable you to solve the problem using 
      the selected solution. 
   6. Evaluate the solution. 
<<<

Six Steps of Problem Solving 

1. Identify the problem 

     The first step toward solving a problem is to identify the problem 

     What is the specific problem?                              
      . This means you should determine what is that you want to change. 

     Clearly define the goal that you want to achieve. 
        What are you trying to achieve? 

     Determine what are the inputs and outputs 

     If you don't know what the problem is, you cannot solve it. 
<<<

 Six Steps of Problem Solving 

2.   Understand the problem 
    . You must understand what is involved in the problem before you can continue 
      toward the solution (you should issue a clear (unambiguous) problem 
      statement). 
    . This includes understanding the rules or the logic for the business 
      (business rules or logic) you are attempt to solve a problem concerned with 
      it. 
    . Also, you must know the suitable set of steps to solve a given problem. You 
      cannot solve a problem if you miss the exact processing steps (arithmetic, 
      relational and logical) to handle it . For example, to solve a problem involving 
      accounting, you must study the accounting life cycle.

3. Identify alternative ways to solve the problem 
   Generate as many potential solutions as possible. 
   List the features for each possible solution 
<<<

Six Steps of Problem Solving 

4. Select the best way to solve the problem from 
   the list of alternative solutions 

   . In this step, you need to identify and evaluate the pros and 
    cons of each possible solution before selecting the best one 

   . In order to do this, you need to select criteria for the evaluation 
<<<

Six Steps of Problem Solving 

5. List instructions that enable you to solve the 
   problem using the selected solution 
        Create a numbered, step-by-step instructions that must fall within the 
       knowledge base set up in step 2 
<<<

Six Steps of Problem Solving 

6. Evaluate the solution 

     To evaluate or test a solution means to check its result to see if it is 

     correct, and to see if it satisfies the needs of the person(s) with the 

     problem. 

     Test the solution 

         Are the results accurate? 

         Does the solution solve the original problem? 

         Does it satisfy the needs of the user? 

         Is it acceptable to the user? 
<<<

     Problem Solving Example 


<<<

Structure of Programs 

. Use modules to break the whole problem into parts, 
  with each part having a particular function. 

. Use the three logic structures to ensure that the 
 solution flows smoothly from one instruction to the next, 
  rather jumping from one point in the solution to another. 
<<<

Structure of Programs 

  Program Structures: 

    The sequential Structure. 

       Ex: Simple calculation. 

   . The Decision Structure. 

     . Ex: Decide if student pass or fail. 

   . The Loop Structure. 

       Ex: Repeat displaying a warning message 10 times. 
<<<

Beginning Computer Concepts for Problem Solving 

. There are 3 types of problem that can be solved in computer: 

· Computational problems 
    involving some kind of mathematical processing 

. Logical Problems 
   · involving relational or logical processing 

. Repetitive Problems 
    involving repeating a set of mathematical and/or logical instructions. 
<<<

Basic building blocks for programming and problem solving 

· Basic building programming blocks: 

      Equations 

           Consist of constant, variables and operators. It incorporates a left hand side LHS (variable of a 
           specific data type), assignment operator '=' and a right hand side RHS (may be value, variable, 
           constant or expression) 

    · Expressions 

           Incorporates arithmetic, relational and logical expressions. It can be used as a right hand side 
           in an assignment expression, as a loop controlling condition or a branching condition in a 
           decision structure. 

    · Functions 

        · Block of code that runs when the function invoked and almost returns a value. 
<<<

Beginning Computer Concepts for Problem Solving 

· Constants: 

     Does not change during the processing of all the instructions in a solution 

     Can be of any data type: numeric, alphabetical or special symbols 

   · Examples 

         3, 5, 10, "Sara", "+", "-", "/" 
<<<

Beginning Computer Concepts for Problem Solving 

· Variables: 
     May change during processing 
   . In many programming languages, variables are called identifiers. 
     A name is assigned to each variable used in a solution and 
     should be consistent with what the value of the variable 
     represents. 
   . The computer uses the variable name to find the location; it uses 
     the value found at the memory location to do the processing. 
· Ex: 
   · Name="Java" 
     Test Score=95 
<<<

Beginning Computer Concepts for Problem Solving 

 Data Types: 

  · Data can come with different type: 
     · Numeric 
     · Character 
      Logical 

    Computer should know the data type of each variable or constant .

Solution Organization Tools 

  Certain organizational tools will help you learn to how solve problems on the computer. 

 The tools include the: 

    Pseudocode Algorithm 
    Flowchart 
<<<

  Algorithm 

The next step of organizing a solution is to develop 

sets of instructions for the computer, called algorithms.

solution is to develop sets of

instructions for the computer,

called algorithms.

  Writing the Algorithm 

 The programmer writes a separate set of instructions 
for each program or (module). 

. The number of instruction is determined by the way 

 the programmer chooses to solve the problem. 
<<<

 Drawing the Flowchart 

· Flowchart is a graphical representation of the algorithm. 

  The algorithms and flowcharts are the final steps in 

  organizing a solution. 

  Both of algorithm and flowcharts shows the flow of 

  processing from the beginning to the end of a solution. 
<<<

Drawing the Flowchart 

 Each block in a flowchart represents one instruction 

 from an algorithm. 

· Flowlines indicate the direction of the data flow. 

. Most block have one or more entrances and have only 

 one exit .

                      . One exit is the action when the resultant is True, and the other 

                        exit is the action when the resultant is False.
