Introduction 

Java application programming 
   Java application: a computer program that executes when you use the java 
   command to launch the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

First Program 

 A statement is a line of code that performs a basic operation. 
 In the previous example, the line is a print statement that displays a message on 
 the screen. 
           System. out.println("Welcome to Java Programming!"); 
 Instructs the computer to perform an action 
     Display the characters contained between the double quotation marks. 
     Together, the quotation marks and the characters between them are a string 
     also known as a character string or a string literal. 
     White-space characters in strings are not ignored by the compiler. 
     Strings cannot span multiple lines of code. 

                                                                             5

 First Program 

  A method is a named sequence of statements. This program defines one method 
  named main. 
                 public static void main(String[] args) 
· Starting point of every Java application. 
  Parentheses after the identifier main indicate that it's a program building block 
  called a method. 
  Java class declarations normally contain one or more methods. 
  main must be defined as shown; otherwise, the JVM will not execute the 
  application. 
  Methods perform tasks and can return information when they complete their tasks. 
· Keyword void indicates that this method will not return any information. 

                                                                            6

First Program 

 Class declaration 
                                 public class Welcome1 
  Every Java program consists of at least one class that you define. 
· class keyword introduces a class declaration and is immediately followed by the class name. 
  Keywords (Appendix C) are reserved for use by Java and are always spelled with all lowercase 
  letters. 
. The name of the class must match the name of the file it is in, so this class must be in a file named 
  Welcome1.java 
  By convention, begin with a capital letter and capitalize the first letter of each word they include 
  (e.g., SampleClassName). 
· A class name is an identifier-a series of characters consisting of letters, digits, underscores (_) 
  and dollar signs ($) that does not begin with a digit and does not contain spaces. 

                                                                                                7

First Program 

 Class Body 
 A left brace, {, begins the body of every class declaration. 
 A corresponding right brace, }, must end each class declaration.

 Commenting Your Programs

    .  / / indicates that the line is a comment. 
    .  Used to document programs and improve their readability. 
    · Compiler ignores comments. 
    . A comment that begins with / / is an end-of-line comment-it terminates at the end of the line 
      on which it appears. 
  Traditional comment, can be spread over several lines as in 
                     /* This is a traditional comment.             It 
                        can be split over multiple lines */ 
      This type of comment begins with /* and ends with */. 
      All text between the delimiters is ignored by the compiler. 
  Blank lines, space characters and tabs are known as white space (or whitespace). 
      They are ignored by the compiler. But make programs easier to read.                 9 
<<<

Common Programming Error 2.1 
Forgetting one of the delimiters of a traditional or Java- 
doc comment is a syntax error. A syntax error occurs 
when the compiler encounters code that violates Java's 
language rules (i.e., its syntax). These rules are similar to 
a natural language's grammar rules specifying sentence 
structure. Syntax errors are also called compiler errors, 
compile-time errors or compilation errors, because the 
compiler detects them when compiling the program. 
When a syntax error is encountered, the compiler issues 
an error message. You must eliminate all compilation er- 
rors before your program will compile properly. 

                                                                  10 
<<<

Common Programming Error 2.2                                 
A compilation error occurs if a public class's filename      
is not exactly same name as the class (in terms of both      pairs. 
spelling and capitalization) followed by the . java ex- 
tension. 

                             Error-Prevention Tip 2.3 
                             When the compiler reports a syntax error, it may not be 
                             on the line that the error message indicates. First, check 
                             the line for which the error was reported. If you don't 
                             find an error on that line, check several preceding lines.

Common Programming Error 2.3 
It's a syntax error if braces do not occur in matching  pairs.
                                                                                                       11

First Program 

· Displaying strings 
  Phrases that appear in quotation marks are called strings, because they contain a 
 sequence of "characters" strung together. Characters can be letters, numbers, 
 punctuation marks, symbols, spaces, tabs, etc. 

  System.out.println appends a special character, called a newline, that moves to 
 the beginning of the next line. If you don't want a newline at the end, you can 
 use print instead of println. 

                                                                               12

System Class 

· System.out object 
    · Standard output object. 
      Allows a Java application to display information in the command window from which it 
      executes. 
  System.out.println method 
      Displays (or prints) a line of text in the command window. 
      The string in the parentheses the argument to the method. 
      Positions the output cursor at the beginning of the next line in the command window. 
  System.out's method print displays a string. 
  Unlike println, print does not position the output cursor at the beginning of the next line in the 
  command window. 
      The next character the program displays will appear immediately after the last character that 
      print displays. 
                                                                                           13

First Program 

· Escape Sequence 
· it is possible to display multiple lines of output in just one line of code. You just 
  must tell Java where to put the line breaks. 
  The backslash (\) is called an escape character. 
    · Indicates a "special character" 
· Backslash is combined with the next character to form an escape sequence-\n 
  represents the newline character. 

                                                                                 15

Declaring variables 

 Programs remember numbers and other data in the computer's memory and access 
 that data through program elements called variables. 
 Every variable has a name, a type, a size (in bytes) and a value. 
 A variable is a named location that stores a value. Values may be numbers, text, 
 images, sounds, and other types of data. To store a value, you first must declare a 
 variable. 
             String message; 
 This statement is a declaration, because it declares that the variable 
 named message has the type String. 
 Each variable has a type that determines what kind of values it can store. For 
 example, the int type can store integers, and the char type can store characters. 
· To declare an integer variable named x, you simply type: int x; 
                                                                              18 
<<<

Declaring variables 

· Variable name is an identifier-a series of characters consisting of letters, digits, underscores 
  (_) and dollar signs ($) that does not begin with a digit and does not contain spaces. 
  Java is case sensitive-uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct-so al and are 
  different (but both valid) identifiers. 

  For declaring multiple variables with the same type on one line: hour and minute are both 
 integers. Note that each declaration statement ends with a semicolon. 

                         int hour, minute; 

. You can use any name you want for a variable. But there are about 50 reserved words, 
  called keywords, that you are not allowed to use as variable names. These words 
 include public, class, static, void, and int, which are used by the compiler to analyze the 
 structure of the program. 

                                                                                         19

Built-in Data Type 

· int: hold integer values [whole numbers such as 72, -1127 and 0]. 

  float and double: hold real number [contain decimal points, such as 3.4, 0.0 and -11.19]. 

· char : hold character data between single quotation mark [such as an uppercase letter (e.g., A), a 

  digit (e.g., 7), a special character (e.g., *or %) or an escape sequence (e.g., the newline character, 
  n)]. 

  string : hold sequence of character between double quotation mark [such as "Hello World", "Hi", 
  "3.14", "true", "2020"]. 

  boolean : hold true or false. 

                                                                                               20

Assignment operation 

. Now that we have declared variables, we want to use them to store values. We do 
  that with an assignment statement. 
   message = "Hello!"; // put in the message variable the value "Hello!" 
   hour = 11;         // assign the value 11 to hour 
   minute = 59;       // set minute to 59 

  When you declare a variable, you create a named storage location. 

· When you make an assignment to a variable, you update its value. 
· When a new value is placed into a variable, the new value replaces the previous 
  value (if any) 

                                                                         22 
<<<

Assignment operation 

   Generally, a variable must have the same type as the value you assign to it. For 
  example, you cannot store a string in minute or an integer in message. We will see 
  some examples that seem to break this rule, but we'll get to that later. 

            message = "123"; // legal 
            message = 123;    // not legal 

  Variables must be initialized (assigned for the first time) before they can be used. 
  You can declare a variable and then assign a value later, as in the previous 
  example. You can also declare and initialize on the same line: 

            String message = "Hello!"; 
            int hour = 11; 
            int minute = 59; 

                                                                               23 
<<<

Assignment operation 

  Because Java uses the = symbol for assignment, it is tempting to interpret the 

  statement a = b as a statement of equality. It is not! 

    · In Java a = 7; is a legal assignment statement, but 7 = a; is not. 

      The left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name (storage location). 

  In Java, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but they don't 

  have to stay that way. 
                                                                          
   int a = 5; int b = a;         / / a and b are now equal               a 3 
   a = 3;                        // a and b are no longer equal          b 5 

                                                                                   24 
<<<

Printing Variables 

  You can display the value of a variable using print or println. The following statements declare a 
  variable named firstLine, assign it the value "Hello, again!", and display that value. 

      Example: 
               String firstLine = "Hello, again!"; 
               System.out.println(firstLine); 
      Output : Hello, again! 

  To display the name of a variable, you have to put it in quotes. 
      Example 
                 System.out.print("The value of firstLine is "); 
                 System.out.println(firstLine); 

       Output: The value of firstLine is Hello, again! 

                                                                                          25

Printing Variables 

   System.out.printf method displays formatted data 

   Multiple method arguments are placed in a comma-separated list. 
 · Method printf's first argument is a format string 
   May consist of fixed text and format specifiers. 
       Fixed text is output as it would be by print or println. 
       Each format specifier is a placeholder for a value and specifies the type of data to output. 
       Format specifiers begin with a percent sign (%) and are followed by a character that represents 
       the data type. Ex: %s is a placeholder for a string.

Arithmetic Operations 

 · Operators are symbols that represent simple computations. For example, the 
  addition operator is +, subtraction is -, multiplication is *, and division is /. 
· An expression, which represents a single value to be computed. When the 
  program runs, each variable is replaced by its current value, and then the operators 
  are applied. The values operators work with are called operands. 

    Example: 
           int hour = 11; 
           int minute = 59; 
           System.out.print("Number of minutes since midnight: "); 
           System.out.println(hour * 60 + minute); 

    Output: Number of minutes since midnight: 719 

                                                                                28

The Scanner Class 

  Scanner is a class that provides methods for inputting words, numbers, 
  and other data. Scanner is provided by java.util, which is a package that 
  contains classes so useful they are called "utility classes". Before you 
  can use Scanner, you have to import it like this: 
                                                                                     
        import java.util. Scanner;                                                      
                                                                                       
. This import statement tells the compiler that when you say Scanner, you 
                                                                                      
  mean the one defined in java.util. Import statements can't be inside a 
  class definition. By convention, they are usually at the beginning of the            
  file.                                                                                
· Variable declaration from Scanner class:                                             

       Scanner input = new Scanner( System.in ); 
    Scanner methods:
    int      nextint()
    short    nextShort()
    double    nextDouble()
    float    nextFloat()
    char    next().chatAt()

Error Types 

  Compile-time errors occur when you violate the syntax rules of the Java 
 language. 
     https://trinket.jo/java/35ddb7b272 (Remove ; from line 5) 

 Run-time error, so-called because it does not appear until after the program has 
 started running. 
   · Ex: divide by zero 

 logic error. If your program has a logic error, it will compile and run without 
 generating error messages, but it will not do the right thing.

 Integer Division 

   The arithmetic operators are binary operators because they each operate on two operands. 

· Integer division yields an integer quotient. 

       Any fractional part in integer division is simply truncated (i.e., discarded) no rounding 
       occurs. 

   The remainder operator, %, yields the remainder after division. 

       Examplet: minute = 59; 
             System.out.print("Fraction of the hour that has passed: "); 
             System.out.println(minute / 60); 

      Output: Fraction of the hour that has passed: 0 

                                                                                        33 
<<<

Floating-point numbers 

  A more general solution is to use floating-point numbers, 
  which can represent fractions as well as integers. 
  In Java, the default floating-point type is called double, which is 
  short for double-precision. 
. You can create double variables and assign values to them using 
  the same syntax we used for the other types. 
   Example: 
         double minute = 59.0; 
         System.out.print("Fraction of the hour that has passed: "); 
         System.out.println(minute / 60.0); 

  Output : Fraction of the hour that has passed: 0.9833333333333333 

                                                                 34

Conversion 

 The following is illegal because the variable on the left is an int and the value on 
 the right is a double: 
                  int x = 1.1; // compiler error 

. In many cases Java automatically converts from one type to another if promotion 
 is possible: 
                 double y = 1; // legal, but bad style 

 The expression on the right divides two integers, so Java does integer division, 
 which yields the int value 0. Converted to double, the value assigned to y is 0.0. 
                 double y = 1 / 3; // common mistake ( logic error) 

                                                                              35 
<<<

Conversion 

  The simplest way to convert a floating-point value to an integer is to use a type cast, so called 
  because it "casts" a value from one type to another. The syntax for type casting is to put the name 
  of the type in parentheses and use it as an operator. 
  The casting used to convert from double to int to avoid compilation error "incompatible types: 
  possible lossy conversion from double to int" 
  The value of x and y in the following code did not change they still contain a double value in the 
  memory. 
     Example: 
         public static void main(String[] args) 
         { double x=3.5; 
            double y=2.3; 
            int z=(int)x+(int)y; 
                                                                      Output: 
            System. out.print ("Sum="+z) ; 
         }                                                            Sum = 5 

                                                                                           36

Increment and Decrement 

Operators 

  Unary increment operator, ++, adds one to its operand 

  Unary decrement operator, -- , subtracts one from its operand 

 An increment or decrement operator that's prefixed to (placed before) a 
 variable is referred to as the prefix increment or prefix decrement 
 operator, respectively. 

 An increment or decrement operator that's postfixed to (placed after) a

Operation on Strings 

  The + operator works with strings, but it might not do what you expect. For 
  strings, the + operator performs concatenation, which means joining end-to-end. 
. When more than one operator appears in an expression, they are evaluated 
  according to order of operations. 

     System. out.println(1 + 2 + "Hello"); // the output is 3Hello 
     System. out.println("Hello" + 1 + 2); // the output is Hello12 

                                                                           43

Math Methods 

. The Java library includes a Math class that provides common mathematical 
 operations. Math is in the java.lang package, so you don't have to import it. 
 You can use, or invoke, Math methods like this: 

                double root = Math. sqrt(17.0); 
                double angle = 1.5; 
                double height = Math. sin(angle); 

      Software Engineering Observation 5.4 
      Class Math is part of the java. lang package, which is 
      implicitly imported by the compiler, so it's not necessary 
      to import class Math to use its methods. 

                                                                              45
