Introduction to Object 

. In Java and other object-oriented languages, an 
  object is a collection of data that provides a set of 
  methods. For example, Scanner, is an object that 
  provides methods for parsing input. System.out and 
  System.in are also objects. 

  Strings are objects, too. They contain characters and 
  provide methods for manipulating character data.

Primitive vs Reference Data Type 

 Java's types are divided into primitive types and reference 
 types. 
     Primitive types: boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, 
     float and double. 
 All nonprimitive types are reference types. 
 A primitive-type variable can hold exactly one value of its 
 declared type at a time. 
  Programs use variables of reference types (normally called 
 references) to store the addresses of objects in the 
 computer's memory. 
     Such a variable is said to refer to an object in the 
     program.

Class String 

· Class String is used to represent strings in Java. 
Create an empty string represented as "" and has a 
 length of 0. 
    String s1 = new String() ; 
Constructor that takes a String object copies the 
 argument into the new String. 
    String str = "Hello"; 
    String s = new String ( "Hello") ; 
    String s2 = new String(s2) ;

 Characters 

   Strings provide a method named charAt, which extracts a character. It 
   returns a char, a primitive type that stores an individual character. 

                String fruit = "banana"; 
                char letter = fruit.charAt(0); 

   The argument 0 means that we want the letter at position 0. Like array 
   indexes, string indexes start at 0, so the character assigned to letter is b. 
 · String method length determines the number of characters in a string. 

String fruit = "banana"; 
System.out.print(fruit. length()); //output 6 
System.out.print( fruit.charAt(fruit. length())); //Error! 
System.out.print( fruit.charAt(fruit. length()-1)); //Correct! 

<<<

Strings are Immutable 

 Strings provide methods, toUpperCase and to LowerCase, 
 that convert from uppercase to lowercase and back. 

 These methods are often a source of confusion, because it 
 sounds like they modify strings. But neither these methods 
 nor any others can change a string, because strings are 
 immutable. 

          String name = "Hello Java"; 
          String upperName = name. toUpperCase( ); 
          System. out.print (name +"\n"+ upperName) ; 

          Output : 
          Hello Java 
          HELLO JAVA 
<<<

Substrings Method 

  The substring method returns a new string that copies letters from an existing 

  string, starting at the given index. 

     · fruit.substring(0) returns "banana" 

     · fruit.substring(2) returns "nana" 

     · fruit.substring(6) returns ""

  There are other versions of substring that have different parameters. If it's 

  invoked with two arguments, they are treated as a start and end index: 

     · fruit.substring(0, 3) returns "ban" 

     · fruit.substring(2, 5) returns "nan" 

     · fruit.substring(6, 6) returns ""
<<<

The indexOf Method 

  The indexOf method searches for a character in a string and it returns 
  the index of the first appearance. 
         String fruit = "banana"; 
         int index = fruit . indexOf ( 'a' ) ; //index=1 

  To find subsequent appearances, you can use another version of 
  indexOf, which takes a second argument that indicates where in the 
  string to start looking.

    int index= fruit fruit.indexOf('a', 2) ; //index=3
                                        

. If the character does not appear in the string, indexOf returns -1. Since 
  indexes cannot be negative, this value indicates the character was not 
  found. 
<<<

The indexOf Method 

· You can also use indexOf to search for a substring, not just a single 
  character. 
         int index = fruit.indexOf ( "nan") ; //index=2 

· Method lastIndexOf locates the last occurrence of a character in a 
  String. The method searches from the end of the String toward the 
  beginning. If it finds the character, it returns the character's index in the 
  String-otherwise, it returns -1. 
· A second version of lastIndexOf takes two integer arguments-the 
  integer representation of the character and the index from which to begin 
  searching backward. 

        String fruit = "banana"; 
        int index = fruit.lastIndexOf ( 'a' ) ; //index=5 
        int index = fruit.lastIndexOf ( 'a', 4) ; //index=3 
<<<

String Comparison 

  equals method used to compare strings. 

  The equals method returns true if the strings contain the 
  same characters; otherwise it returns false. 

  String method equalsIgnoreCase ignores whether the letters 
  in each String are uppercase or lowercase when performing 
  the comparison. 

 String name1 = "Java"; 
 String name2 = "JAVA"; 

 boolean answer= name1. equals(name2) ; 
 System. out.print ln("Answer="+answer); //output false 

 answer= name1. equalsIgnoreCase(name2) ; 
 System. out.println("Answer="+answer); //output true 
<<<

String Comparison 

  We can use compareTo to see which comes first in alphabetical 
  order. The return value from compareTo is the difference between 
  the first characters in the strings that differ. 
      If the strings are equal, their difference is zero. 
      If the first string (the one on which the method is invoked) comes first in 
      the alphabet, the difference is negative. Otherwise, the difference is 
      positive. 

       String name1 = "Alan Turing"; 
       String name2 = "Ada Lovelace"; 
       int answer= name1. compareTo(name2) ; 
       System. out.print ln("Answer="+answer); //output positive 8 

      In the preceding code, compareTo returns positive 8, because the second 
      letter of "Ada" comes before the second letter of "Alan" by 8 letters. 

      Both equals and compareTo are case-sensitive. The uppercase letters 
      come before the lowercase letters, so "Ada" comes before "ada". 
<<<

String Checking 

 String methods startsWith and endsWith 
 determine whether strings start with or end with a 
 particular set of characters. 
 String name1 = "started"; 
 String name2 = "start"; 
 String name4 = "end"; 

 System.out.println(name1.startsWith('s' )); //output true 
 System.out.println(name1.startsWith("st")); //output true 

 System. out.println(name2.startsWith('s') ); //output true 
 System.out.println(name2.startsWith("st")); //output true 

 System. out.println(name1.endsWith('d' )); //output true 
 System.out.println(name1. endsWith("ed")); //output true 

 System.out.println(name2.endsWith('d' )); //output false 
 System.out.println(name3.endsWith('d' )); //output true
