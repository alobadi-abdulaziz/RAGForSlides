for Repetition Statement 

· The loops we have written so far have several 
  elements in common. 
     They start by initializing a variable, 
     they have a condition that depends on that variable, and 
     inside the loop they do something to update that variable. 

. This type of loop is so common that there is another 
  statement, the for loop, that expresses it more 
  concisely.

for Repetition Statement (Cont.) 

  The general format of the for statement is 

     for (initialization; loopContinuationCondition; 
                              update) 
      the initialization expression names the loop's control variable and 
      optionally provides its initial value 
      loopContinuationCondition determines whether the loop should 
      continue executing 

      update modifies the control variable's value, so that the loop- 
      continuation condition eventually becomes false. 

                                                                  4

. The two semicolons in the for header are required. 

. If the loop-continuation condition is initially false, the 

 program does not execute the for statement's body. Instead, 

 execution proceeds with the statement following the for.

 While statement: 
                 int counter=1; 
                 while (counter <= 10) 
                  { 
                    statement 
                    counter++; 
                  } 

For statement: 


                  for (int counter = 1; counter <= 10; counter++) 

 

Typically, for statements are used for counter-controlled repetition and while 
statements for sentinel-controlled repetition.

 The for loop is often easier to read because it puts 
 all the loop-related statements at the top of the loop. 
. There is one difference between for loops and while 
 loops: if you declare a variable in the initializer, it 
 only exists inside the for loop. 

     for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i = i + 1) 
     { 
        System.out.println(i); 
     } 
      System.out.println(i); // compiler error

Common Programming Error 4.3 
 When a for statement's control variable is declared in 
 the initialization section of the for's header, using the 
control variable after the for's body is a compilation 
error. 

    int i = 1; 
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i = i + 1) 
    { 
        System.out.println(i); 
    } 
     System. out.println(i); // it will work!

<<<

 Common Programming Error 4.4 
 Placing a semicolon immediately to the right of the right 
 parenthesis of a for header makes that for's body an 
 empty statement. This is normally a logic error. 

for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++); 
{ 
    System.out.println(i); // it will not print i 

}

. All three expressions in a for header are optional. 

    . If the loopContinuationCondition is omitted, the condition is always 

      true, thus creating an infinite loop. 

      You might omit the initialization expression if the program 
      initializes the control variable before the loop. 

      You might omit the increment if the program calculates it with 
      statements in the loop's body or if no increment is needed. 

                                                                   12

. The increment expression in a for acts as if it were a 

  standalone statement at the end of the for's body, so 

        counter = counter + 1 
        counter += 1 
        ++counter 
        counter++ 

  are equivalent increment expressions in a for statement.

  The initialization, loop-continuation condition and 
  increment can contain arithmetic expressions. 
        for (int j = x; j <= 4 * x * y; j += y / X) 

. The increment of a for statement may be negative, 
  in which case it's a decrement, and the loop counts 
  downward. 
       for (int k = 10; k >= 1; k-- )

 Vary the control variable from 100 to 1 in decrements of 1. 

            for (int i = 100; i >= 1; i -- ) 

  Vary the control variable from 7 to 77 in increments of 7. 

            for (int i = 7; i <= 77; i += 7) 

                                                               15

4.4 Examples Using the for Statement (Cont.) 

  The initialization and increment expressions can be 
  comma-separated lists that enable you to use 
  multiple initialization expressions or multiple 
  increment expressions. 

for (int i= 2, j=0; i <= 20; i += 2) 
 j += i ;

4.4 Examples Using the for Statement (Cont.) 

· Body of the for statement could be merged into the 
  increment portion of the for header by using a 
  comma as follows: 
      for (int i= 2, j=0; i <= 20; j += i, i += 2) 
           ; / / empty statement 

      Can be written as following: 

      for (int i= 2, j=0; 
       i <= 20; 
       j += i, i += 2) 
           ; / / empty statement

4.5 do ... while Repetition Statement 

 The do ... while repetition statement is similar to the 
 while statement. 
. In the while, the program tests the loop-continuation 
 condition at the beginning of the loop, before executing 
 the loop's body; if the condition is false, the body never 
 executes. 
 The do ... while statement tests the loop-continuation 
 condition after executing the loop's body; therefore, the 
 body always executes at least once. 
 When a do ... while statement terminates, execution 
 continues with the next statement in sequence.

4.7 break and continue Statements 

. The break statement, when executed in a while, 
  for, do ... while or switch, causes immediate 
 exit from that statement. 
· Execution continues with the first statement after 
 the control statement. 
. Common uses of the break statement are to escape 
 early from a loop or to skip the remainder of a 
  switch.

4.7 break and continue Statements (Cont.) 

. The continue statement, when executed in a 
 while, for or do ... while, skips the remaining 
 statements in the loop body and proceeds with the 
 next iteration of the loop. 
. In while and do ... while statements, the 
 program evaluates the loop-continuation test 
 immediately after the continue statement 
 executes. 
. In a for statement, the increment expression 
 executes, then the program evaluates the loop- 
 continuation test.
