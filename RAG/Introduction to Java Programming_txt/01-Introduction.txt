1.1 Introduction 

  Computers (often referred to as hardware) are 
  controlled by software (i.e., the instructions you write 
  to command the computer to perform actions and make 
  decisions). 

  You'll learn to write instructions commanding 
  computers to perform tasks. 

  Java is one of the world's most widely used computer 
  programming languages.

1.1 Introduction (Cont.) 

   For many organizations, the preferred language for 

   meeting their enterprise programming needs is Java. 

   Java is also widely used for implementing Internet- 

   based applications and software for devices that 

   communicate over a network.

1.2 Hardware and Software 

    Computers can perform calculations and make logical decisions 
    phenomenally faster than human beings can. 

    Today's personal computers can perform billions of calculations in one 
    second-more than a human can perform in a lifetime. 

    Supercomputers are already performing thousands of trillions 
    (quadrillions) of instructions per second! 

    Computers process data under the control of sequences of instructions 
    called computer programs. 

    A computer consists of various devices referred to as hardware. 

    The programs that run on a computer are referred to as software.

1.2.2 Computer Organization 

   Computers can be envisioned as divided into six logical units 
   or sections: 
     Input unit. This "receiving" section obtains from input devices and 
     places it at the disposal of the other units so that it can be processed. 

     Output unit. This "shipping" section takes information that the computer 
     has processed and places it on various output devices to make it 
     available for use outside the computer. 

     Memory unit. This rapid-access, relatively low-capacity "warehouse" 
     section retains information that has been entered through the input unit, 
     making it immediately available for processing when needed. It also 
     retains processed information until it can be placed on output devices by 
     the output unit. Information in the memory unit is volatile. The memory 
     unit is often called either memory or primary memory.

1.2.2 Computer Organization (cont.) 

     Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU). This " manufacturing" section 
     performs calculations. It also contains the computer's decision 
     mechanisms. In today's systems, the ALU is usually implemented as 
     part of the next logical unit, the CPU. 

      Central processing unit (CPU). This " administrative" section 
      coordinates and supervises the operation of the other sections. 
        Tells the input unit when information should be read into the memory unit 
        Tells the ALU when information from the memory unit should be used in 
        calculations 
        Tells the output unit when to send information from the memory unit to 
        certain output devices. 
        Many of today's computers have multiple CPUs and, hence, can perform 
        many operations simultaneously-such computers are called multiprocessors. 
        A multi-core processor implements multiprocessing on a single integrated 
        circuit chip.

1.2.2 Computer Organization (cont.) 

     Secondary storage unit. This is the long-term, high-capacity 
     "warehousing" section. Programs or data not actively being 
     used by the other units normally are placed on secondary 
     storage devices (e.g., your hard drive) until they're again 
     needed, possibly hours, days, months or even years later. 
     Therefore, information on secondary storage devices is said to 
     be persistent.

1.4 Machine Languages, Assembly Languages and High-Level Languages 

   Programmers write instructions in various programming 
   languages, some directly understandable by computers and 
   others requiring intermediate translation steps. 

   Programming languages may be divided into three general 
   types: 
     Machine languages 
     Assembly languages 
     High-level languages

1.4 Machine Languages, Assembly Languages and High-Level Languages (Cont.) 

  Machine Languages 
    Any computer can directly understand only its own machine language 
    (machine-dependent). 
    Consist of strings of numbers (ultimately reduced to 1s and Os) that instruct 
    computers to perform their most elementary operations one at a time. 
    Writing programs in machine language is very hard and error prone 

 Assembly Languages and Assemblers 
    Low level languages where strings of 1s and Os are replaced by 
    mnemonics: ADD, SUB, etc. 
    Translator programs called Assemblers convert early assembly-language 
    programs to machine language.

1.4 Machine Languages, Assembly Languages and High-Level Languages (Cont.) 

 High-Level Languages and Compilers 
  High-level languages allow to write instructions that look 
   almost like everyday English and contain commonly used 
  mathematical notations: Single statements accomplish 
   substantial tasks. 

   Translator programs called Compilers convert high-level 
  language programs into machine language. 

  Writing programs in high-level language is faster and easier to 
  maintain than in assembly language

1.6 Operating Systems 

   Software systems that make using computers more convenient. 

   Provide services that allow each application to execute safely, efficiently 
   and concurrently (i.e., in parallel) with other applications. 

   The software that contains the core components of the operating system is 
   called the kernel. 

   Popular desktop operating systems include Linux, Windows 7 and Mac OS 
   X. 

   Popular mobile operating systems used in smartphones and tablets include 
   Google's Android, Apple's iOS (for its iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch 
   devices), Windows Phone and Blackberry OS.

1.7 Programming Languages 

  Programming 
  language       Description 

  Fortran        Fortran (FORmula TRANslator) was developed by IBM Corporation in the mid- 
                  1950s for scientific and engineering applications that require complex mathemati- 
                 cal computations. It's still widely used, and its latest versions support object-ori- 
                 ented programming. 
  COBOL          COBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language) was developed in the late 
                  1950s by computer manufacturers, the U.S. government and industrial computer 
                 users based on a language developed by Grace Hopper, a U.S. Navy Rear Admiral 
                 and computer scientist who also advocated for the international standardization of 
                 programming languages. COBOL is still widely used for commercial applications 
                 that require precise and efficient manipulation of large amounts of data. Its latest 
                 version supports object-oriented programming. 
  Pascal         Research in the 1960s resulted in structured programming a disciplined approach 
                 to writing programs that are clearer, easier to test and debug and easier to modify 
                 than large programs produced with previous techniques. One result of this research 
                 was the development in 1971 of the Pascal programming language, which was 
                 designed for teaching structured programming and was popular in college courses 
                 for several decades.

1.7 Programming Languages(cont.)

  Programming 
  language       Description 

  Ada            Ada, based on Pascal, was developed under the sponsorship of the U.S. Depart- 
                 ment of Defense (DOD) during the 1970s and early 1980s. The DOD wanted a 
                 single language that would fill most of its needs. The Ada language was named 
                 after Lady Ada Lovelace, daughter of the poet Lord Byron. She's credited with writ- 
                 ing the world's first computer program in the early 1800s (for the Analytical 
                 Engine mechanical computing device designed by Charles Babbage). Ada also sup- 
                 ports object-oriented programming. 
  Basic          Basic was developed in the 1960s at Dartmouth College to familiarize novices with 
                 programming techniques. Many of its latest versions are object oriented. 
  C              C was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories. It ini- 
                 tially became widely known as the UNIX operating system's development lan- 
                 guage. Today, most of the code for general-purpose operating systems is written in 
                 C or C++. 
  C++            C++, which is based on C, was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s 
                 at Bell Laboratories. C++ provides several features that "spruce up" the C language, 
                 but more important, it provides capabilities for object-oriented programming.

1.7 Programming Languages(cont.)

  Programming 
  language       Description 

  Objective-C    Objective-C is another object-oriented language based on C. It was developed in 
                 the early 1980s and later acquired by NeXT, which in turn was acquired by Apple. 
                 It has become the key programming language for the OS X operating system and 
                 all iOS-powered devices (such as iPods, iPhones and iPads). 
  Visual Basic   Microsoft's Visual Basic language was introduced in the early 1990s to simplify the 
                 development of Microsoft Windows applications. Its latest versions support object- 
                 oriented programming. 
  Visual C#      Microsoft's three object-oriented primary programming languages are Visual Basic 
                 (based on the original Basic), Visual C++ (based on C++) and Visual C# (based on 
                 C++ and Java, and developed for integrating the Internet and the web into com- 
                 puter applications). 
  PHP            PHP, an object-oriented, open-source scripting language supported by a commu- 
                 nity of users and developers, is used by millions of websites. PHP is platform inde- 
                 pendent-implementations exist for all major UNIX, Linux, Mac and Windows 
                 operating systems. PHP also supports many databases, including the popular 
                 open-source MySQL.

1.7 Programming Languages(cont.)

  Programming 
  language      Description 
  Perl          Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language), one of the most widely used 
                object-oriented scripting languages for web programming, was developed in 1987 
                by Larry Wall. It features rich text-processing capabilities. 
  Python        Python, another object-oriented scripting language, was released publicly in 1991. 
                Developed by Guido van Rossum of the National Research Institute for Mathe- 
                matics and Computer Science in Amsterdam (CWI), Python draws heavily from 
                Modula-3-a systems programming language. Python is "extensible"-it can be 
                extended through classes and programming interfaces. 
  JavaScript    JavaScript is the most widely used scripting language. It's primarily used to add 
                dynamic behavior to web pages-for example, animations and improved interac- 
                tivity with the user. It's provided with all major web browsers. 
  Ruby on Rails Ruby, created in the mid-1990s, is an open-source, object-oriented programming 
                language with a simple syntax that's similar to Python. Ruby on Rails combines the 
                scripting language Ruby with the Rails web application framework developed by 
                37Signals. Their book, Getting Real (gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php), is a 
                must read for web developers. Many Ruby on Rails developers have reported pro- 
                ductivity gains over other languages when developing database-intensive web 
                applications.

1.9 A Typical Java Development Environment (Cont.) 

   Phase 1 consists of editing a file with an editor program 

      Using the editor, you type a Java program (source code). 

      Make any necessary corrections. 

       Save the program. 

      Java source code files are given a name ending with the .java extension 

      indicating that the file contains Java source code. 
      Program is created in an 
      editor and stored on disk in 
      a file whose name ends 
      with .java

   Phase 2: Compiling a Java Program into Bytecodes 

      If the program compiles, the compiler produces a .class file 

      called Welcome. class that contains the compiled version. 

    Compiler creates bytecodes 
    and stores them on disk in a 
    Disk file whose name ends 
    with .class

     Phase 3: Execution 

        The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)-a part of the JDK and the 

        foundation of the Java platform-executes bytecodes. 

        To execute the program, the 
        JVM reads bytecodes and 
        just-in-time (JIT) compiles 
        (i.e., translates) them into a 
        language that the computer 
        can understand. As the 
        program executes, it may store 
        data values in primary 
        memory.

1.9 A Typical Java Development Environment (Cont.) 

    Java programs go through two compilation phases 

    One in which source code is translated into bytecodes (for 

    portability across JVMs on different computer platforms) 
    and 

    A second in which, during execution, the bytecodes are 
    translated into machine language for the actual computer on 

    which the program executes.
