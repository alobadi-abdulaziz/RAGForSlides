Introduction 

 Data structures-collections of related 

 data items. 

 Array objects-data structures consisting 
 of related data items of the same type. 

 Make it convenient to process related 

 groups of values.

Creating Arrays 

  An array is a sequence of values; the values in the 
  array are called elements. 

. You can make an array of ints, doubles, or any other 
  type, but all the values in an array must have the same 
  type. 

  To create an array, you have to declare a variable with 
  an array type and then create the array itself. Array 
  types look like other Java types, except they are 
  followed by square brackets ([]). 
<<<

Creating Arrays 

  For example, the following lines declare that 
  counts is an "integer array" and values is a 
  "double array"
     int[] counts; 
     double [] values; 
     int size=3; //variable 

· To create the array itself, you have to use the new operator:
    counts = new int [4] ; 
    values = new double [size] ; 

Of course, you can also declare the variable and create the array in a single line of code:
    int [] counts = new int [4]; 
    double [] values = new double [size] ; 
<<<

Accessing Elements 

   When you create an array of ints, the elements are initialized to zero. 

 . Also, you can initialize array directly in the declration line with known values 
   as: 

                       int [] counts = {1, 2, 3, 4}; 
   The arrow indicates that the value of counts is a reference to the array. You 
   should think of the array and the variable that refers to it as two different 
   things. 

   The large numbers inside the boxes are the elements of the array. The small 
   numbers outside the boxes are the indexes (or indices) used to identify each 
   location in the array. 

   Notice that the index of the first element is 0, not 1, as you might have 
   expected. 
<<<

Accessing Elements 

  The [] operator selects elements from an array and 
 you can use the [] operator anywhere in an 
  expression; 
  counts[1] = counts[0] * 2; counts[2]++; counts[3] -= 60; 
  System.out.println("The zeroth element is " + counts[0]); 

  You can use any expression as an index, as long as 
  it has type int. 
<<<

  Accessing Elements 

     Array names follow the same conventions as other 
     variable names (c, array2, intArray, etc.). 
     An index must be a nonnegative integer (c[ -3] not allowed). 

     The highest index in an array is one less than the number 
     of elements. 

     A program can use an expression as an index (c[i-j+1]). 

     Array-access expressions can be used on the left side of 
     an assignment to place a new value into an array 
     element.                                            
Common Programming Error 6.1                             
An indexZmust be dh Ont value or a value of a type that 
 can be promoted to int-namely, byte, short or           
 char, but not long; otherwise, a compilation error oc-curs 

Error-Prevention Tip 6.1
When writing code to access an array element, ensure
that the array index remains greater than or equal to 0 
and less than the length of the array. This would prevent
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions if your pro-gram is correct.

Common Errors 

 Common Programming Error 6.2 
  In an array declaration, specifying the number of ele- 
  ments in the square brackets of the declaration (e.g., 
  int [12] c;) is a syntax error. 

  Common Programming Error 6.3 
  Declaring multiple array variables in a single declara- 
  tion can lead to subtle errors. Consider the declaration 
  int[] a, b, c ;. Ifa, b and c should be declared as ar- 
  ray variables, then this declaration is correct-placing 
  square brackets directly following the type indicates that 
  all the identifiers in the declaration are array variables. 
  However, if only a is intended to be an array variable, 
  and b and c are intended to be individual int vari- 
  ables, then this declaration is incorrect-the declaration 
  int a[], b, c; would achieve the desired result.

Multidimensional arrays 

 Multidimensional arrays with two 
 dimensions are often used to represent 
 tables of values with data arranged in 
 rows and columns. 
    To identify a particular table element we use: 
    array [i] [j] 
       i identifies the element's row and j identifies the 
       element's column 
 Arrays that require two indices to identify 
 each element are called two-dimensional 
 arrays. 
<<<

Multidimensional arrays 

  Figure 6.11 illustrates a two-dimensional 
  array named a with three rows and four 
  columns (i.e., a three-by-four array). 

  In general, an array with m rows and n 
  columns is called an m-by-n array. 

<<<

Multidimensional arrays 

  Multidimensional arrays can be initialized with array 
 initializers in declarations. 
 A two-dimensional array b with two rows and two 
 columns could be declared and initialized with nested 
 array initializers as follows: 
      · int[][] b = { { 1, 2 }, { 3, 4 } }; 
 The initial values are grouped by row in braces. 
. The compiler counts the number of nested array 
 initializers to determine the number of rows in array b. 
. The compiler counts the initializer values in the nested 
 array initializer for a row to determine the number of 
 columns in that row. 
 Rows can have different lengths. 
<<<

Multidimensional arrays 

  A multidimensional array with the same number of 
 columns in every row can be created with an array- 
  creation expression, as in: 
        int[][] b = new int[3][4]; 
  Programs can also use variables to specify array 
  dimensions, because new creates arrays at execution 
  time-not at compile time. 
  The elements of a multidimensional array are initialized 
 when the array object is created. 
  A multidimensional array in which each row has a 
  different number of columns can be created as follows: 
        int[][] b = new int[2][ ]; // create 2 rows 
        b[0] = new int[5]; // create 5 columns for row 0 
        b[1] = new int[3]; // create 3 columns for row 1 
<<<

Array Class 

   Class Arrays helps you avoid reinventing the wheel by providing methods for 

   common array manipulations. 

   Class Arrays must be imported in the program. 

                      import java. util. Arrays; 

   Class Arrays methods include: 

        sort for sorting an array (i.e., arranging elements into ascending order), 

        binarySearch for searching a sorted array (i.e., determining whether an array 
        contains a specific value and, if so, where the value is located), 

        equals for comparing arrays 

        fill for placing values into an array. 

        toString for returns a string representation of the contents of this array enclosed by [].

Example 1 

import java. util. Arrays; 

public class example1 { 
  public static void main (String[ ] args) 
   { 
      // Get the Array 
      int intArr [] = { 10, 20, 15, 22, 35 }; 

      Arrays. sort (intArr ) ; 

      int intKey = 22; 

      / / Print the key and corresponding index 
      System. out. print ln( 
         intKey + " found at index = " 
         + Arrays. binarySearch ( intArr, intKey) ) ; 
   } 
} 
      Output : 
      22 found at index = 3 

                  What if the intKey=5 ?! 
<<<

Example 2 

 import java. util. Arrays; 

 public class Main { 
    public static void main (String[] args) 
    { 

        / / Get the Arrays 
        int intArr[] = { 10, 20, 15, 22, 35 } ; 

        / / Get the second Arrays 
        int intArr1[] = { 10, 15, 22}; 

        / / To compare both arrays 
        System. out . println( "Integer Arrays on comparison: " 
                        + Arrays . equals ( intArr, intArr1) ); 
    } 
 } 

       Output : 
       Integer Arrays on comparison:     false

Example 3 

 import java. util. Arrays; 

 public class example3 { 
    public static void main (String[] args) 
     { 

        / / Get the Arrays 
        int intArr [] = { 10, 20, 15, 22, 35 } ; 

        int intKey = 22; 

        Arrays. fill(intArr, intKey) ; 

        / / To fill the arrays 
        System. out.println( "Integer Array on filling: " 
                          + Arrays. toString( intArr ) ) ; 
    } 
 } 

        Output : 
        Integer Array on filling:      [22, 22,   22, 22, 22]
