 Repetition Control Statements in High-Level Language 

. There are mainly two types of loops: 
     Entry Controlled loops: 
         In this type of loop, the test condition is tested 
        before entering the loop body. 
       Ex: For loop and While loop. 
     Exit Controlled Loops: 
         In this type of loop the test condition is tested or 
        evaluated at the end of the loop body. Therefore, 
        the loop body will execute at least once, irrespective 
        of whether the test condition is true or false. 
       Ex: do-while loop.

  While Loop 

                                                            
 Repetition statement-repeats an action while a 
condition remains true. 

 The repetition statement's body may be a single           
statement or a block. 
                                                                   
 Eventually, the condition will become false. At 
this point, the repetition terminates, and the first 
                                                           
statement after the repetition statement executes. 

                                                            

                                                                    8

 While Loop 



  The expression in parentheses is called the continuation condition. The 

  statements in braces are called the body. 
  The flow of execution for a while statement is: 
       Evaluate the condition, yielding true or false. 
       If the condition is false, skip the body and go to the next statement. 
       If the condition is true, execute the body and go back to step 1. 
. This type of flow is called a loop, because the last step loops back 
  around to the first.                                                 9

Counter-Controlled While Loop 

  Counter-controlled repetition requires 
     a control variable (or loop counter) 
     the initial value of the control variable 
     the increment by which the control variable is modified 
     each time through the loop (also known as each 
     iteration of the loop) 
     the loop-continuation condition that determines if 
     looping should continue.

Counter-Controlled While Loop

   Common Programming Error 4. 
   Because floating-point values may be approximate, con- 
   trolling loops with floating-point variables may result in 
   imprecise counter values and inaccurate termination 
   tests. 

     Error-Prevention Tip 4.1 
     Use integers to control counting loops.

Infinite While Loop 

  int n=1;                               int n=1; 
  while (n > 0) {                        while (true) { 
  System.out.println(n);                 System.out.println(n); 
      n++; }                                 n++; } 

               Common Programming Error 3.2 
               Not providing in the body of a while statement an ac- 
               tion that eventually causes the condition in the while to 
               become false normally results in a logic error called an 
               infinite loop (the loop never terminates). 

                                                                       13

         Common Programming Error 4.2 
         Using an incorrect relational operator or an incorrect fi- 
         nal value of a loop counter in the loop-continuation con- 
         dition of a repetition statement can cause an off-by-one 
         error.

Formulating Algorithms: Counter-Controlled Repetition 

 A class of ten students took a quiz. The grades 
  (integers in the range 0 to 100) for this quiz are 
  available to you. Determine the class average on the 
  quiz. 
  The class average is equal to the sum of the grades divided by the 
 number of students. 
  The algorithm for solving this problem on a computer must input 
 each grade, keep track of the total of all grades input, perform the 
 averaging calculation and print the result. 
  Use counter-controlled repetition to input the grades one at a time. 
  A variable called a counter (or control variable) controls the number 
  of times a set of statements will execute. 
  Counter-controlled repetition is often called definite repetition, 
 because the number of repetitions is known before the loop begins 
  executing.

  A total is a variable used to accumulate the sum of several values. 

· A counter is a variable used to count. 

  Variables used to store totals are normally initialized to zero before 
  being used in a program.

Formulating Algorithms: Counter-Controlled Repetition (Cont.) 

  A local variable's declaration must appear before the 
  variable is used in the program. 
      Common Programming Error 3.3 
      Using the value of a local variable before it's initialized 
      results in a compilation error. All local variables must be 
      initialized before their values are used in expressions. 

      Error-Prevention Tip 3.3 
      Initialize each total and counter, either in its declara- 
      tion or in an assignment statement. Totals are normally 
      initialized to 0. Counters are normally initialized to 0 
      or 1, depending on how they're used (we'll show exam- 
      ples of when to use O and when to use 1).

 Formulating Algorithms: Sentinel-Controlled Repetition 

  Develop a class-averaging program that 
  processes grades for an arbitrary number of 
  students each time it's run. 
· Sentinel-controlled repetition is often called indefinite 
  repetition because the number of repetitions is not known 
  before the loop begins executing. 
· A special value called a sentinel value (also called a signal 
  value, a dummy value or a flag value) can be used to 
  indicate "end of data entry." 
  A sentinel value must be chosen that cannot be confused 
  with an acceptable input value.

Good Programming Practice 3.3 
In a sentinel-controlled loop, prompts should remind the 
user of the sentinel. 

Common Programming Error 3.5 
Omitting the braces that delimit a block can lead to logic 
errors, such as infinite loops. To prevent this problem, 
some programmers enclose the body of every control state- 
ment in braces, even if the body contains only a single 
statement.

      another test result. 
      Count the number of test results of each type. 
      Display a summary of the test results, indicating the number
